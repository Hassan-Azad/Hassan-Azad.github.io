            Thankyou for showing interest,
			here is a quick story of me and
			this website. My programming
			journey started back in 2019,
			few months before I started
			studying CSE in LNCT Bhopal.
			I am currently in my second
			year and doing Technical
			Content Writing Internship
			at GeeksForGeeks. I like
			coding all kind of problems
			from the very basic like adding
			numbers to the complex ones like
			competitive programming problems.
			I love making projects and games.
			Infact this website is one of my
			Web Development Projects which
			is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
			<br>Languages known : C Language,
			C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript,
			MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data
			Structures and Algorithm, OOP,
			HTML, CSS, LINUX, and Git & GitHub.
